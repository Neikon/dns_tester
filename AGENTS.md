## Instructions
- All source code and comments must be written in English, regardless of author.
- Chat conversation should be in Spanish unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Every piece of code must include comments, even if not authored by the agent.
- Any git commits must always use the user's name as the author.
- When both Adwaita and GTK provide a class for the needed goal, prefer the Adwaita variant.
- Commit messages must always be written in English.
- Even if asked to "make a commit", you may split work into multiple commits when it improves clarity and separates concerns.

## Slash Commands
- /commit <message>: Stage tracked changes and create a git commit using the user's name as author.
